# Water Jug Problem  

One of two challenges made for Chicks Gold, both projects were made in React to showcase my capacity to use the framework and develop components nicely, and also because I've already showcased one project I've made in Angular and it's a bit much for what it's asked of me in both challenges.  

### Mathematical Solution  



#### Test Cases  



## Instructions  

One detail that might be important is the fact that I use pnpm as a package manager and PostCSS as a CSS preprocessor, which should explain the YAML files present (the PostCSS config is also in YAML just to maintain some consistency). The fact that I use pnpm also means that if you want to run the page you would have to use pnpm dev, OR, alternatively, use npm install so you get a package-lock.json first, then run it through npm run dev.  

Once the program is setup, simply input the amount of water for jugs 1 and 2 then input the amount Z of gallons to calculate. Once you're done, just click on the 'Calculate' button, and if all fields make for a measurable solution (i.e the sum of both jugs is more or equal than amount Z, neither jug is smaller than 1L, and they satisfy the equation mentioned in the mathematical solution approach), the solution, including its amount of total steps, should appear on the screen.
